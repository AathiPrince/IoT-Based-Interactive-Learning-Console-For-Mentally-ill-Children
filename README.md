This project introduces an interactive educational console designed specifically for children with intellectual disabilities, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The system leverages Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to create a tactile, visual, and auditory learning experience focused on developing foundational literacy and numeracy skills.

Children interact with a 2.4-inch TFT display that presents questions (like a letter, number, or color), and respond using NFC-embedded cards. When the correct card is scanned, the device delivers positive feedback through sound and visuals, encouraging learning and engagement. Incorrect answers prompt supportive retry messages, maintaining motivation.

🎯 Key Features:
Multisensory learning: Combines touch, sight, and sound for immersive engagement.

Arduino-based hardware: Uses Arduino Mega, MFRC522 NFC reader, TFT display, and audio components.

Accessible interaction: Simple button-based navigation with real-time feedback.

Designed for inclusivity: Built to accommodate children with cognitive and motor skill challenges.

🔍 Problem Solved:
Existing edtech tools often lack tactile interactivity and adaptive feedback mechanisms for children with special needs. Our solution offers a cost-effective, scalable, and child-friendly device that encourages independent learning through gamified interactions.

📈 Results:
Preliminary testing showed a significant improvement in learners' recognition and engagement over a 4-week period, with children increasingly identifying characters correctly and participating more independently.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Hardware: Arduino Mega 2560, MFRC522 NFC module, TFT LCD (ILI9341), tactile buttons, speaker

Software: Arduino IDE (C/C++), libraries: MFRC522, Adafruit_GFX, Adafruit_ILI9341, TMRpcm

🚀 Future Enhancements:
Cloud-enabled Learning Management System (LMS) for tracking progress

Image-based modules, emoji support, and multilingual audio

Speech interaction for a more conversational learning experience

Enhanced NFC range and content configurability
